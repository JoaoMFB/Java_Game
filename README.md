**2D Puzzle Game Project in Java**

This project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming discipline and consists of a 2D puzzle game (inspired by Minecraft) with four different levels. The goal of the game is to provide an interactive and challenging experience to players, encouraging logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.

### Key Features:

1. **Graphical Interface:** The game features an intuitive graphical interface, using visual resources to make the experience more engaging.

2. **Levels:** There are four distinct levels, each with a unique puzzle challenge that increases in difficulty. Players must solve the challenges to progress to the next level.
